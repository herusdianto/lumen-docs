## Accessing The Request

To obtain an instance of the current HTTP request via dependency injection, you should type-hint the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class on your controller constructor or method. The current request instance will automatically be injected by the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container):

    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * Store a new user.
         *
         * @param  Request  $request
         * @return Response
         */
        public function store(Request $request)
        {
            $name = $request->input('name');

            //
        }
    }

If your controller method is also expecting input from a route parameter, simply list your route arguments after your other dependencies. For example, if your route is defined like so:

    $app->put('user/{id}', 'UserController@update');

You may still type-hint the `Illuminate\Http\Request` and access your route parameter `id` by defining your controller method like the following:

    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * Update the specified user.
         *
         * @param  Request  $request
         * @param  string  $id
         * @return Response
         */
        public function update(Request $request, $id)
        {
            //
        }
    }

### Basic Request Information

The `Illuminate\Http\Request` instance provides a variety of methods for examining the HTTP request for your application and extends the `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` class. Here are a few more of the useful methods available on this class:

#### Retrieving The Request URI

The `path` method returns the request's URI. So, if the incoming request is targeted at `http://domain.com/foo/bar`, the `path` method will return `foo/bar`:

    $uri = $request->path();

The `is` method allows you to verify that the incoming request URI matches a given pattern. You may use the `*` character as a wildcard when utilizing this method:

    if ($request->is('admin/*')) {
        //
    }

To get the full URL, not just the path info, you may use the `url` or `fullUrl` methods on the request instance:

    // Without Query String...
    $url = $request->url();

    // With Query String...
    $url = $request->fullUrl();

#### Retrieving The Request Method

The `method` method will return the HTTP verb for the request. You may also use the `isMethod` method to verify that the HTTP verb matches a given string:

    $method = $request->method();

    if ($request->isMethod('post')) {
        //
    }

### PSR-7 Requests

The PSR-7 standard specifies interfaces for HTTP messages, including requests and responses. If you would like to obtain an instance of a PSR-7 request, you will first need to install a few libraries. Laravel uses the Symfony HTTP Message Bridge component to convert typical Laravel requests and responses into PSR-7 compatible implementations:

    composer require symfony/psr-http-message-bridge

    composer require zendframework/zend-diactoros

Once you have installed these libraries, you may obtain a PSR-7 request by simply type-hinting the request type on your route or controller:

    use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

    $app->get('/', function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
        //
    });

If you return a PSR-7 response instance from a route or controller, it will automatically be converted back to a Laravel response instance and be displayed by the framework.

## Retrieving Input

#### Retrieving An Input Value

Using a few simple methods, you may access all user input from your `Illuminate\Http\Request` instance. You do not need to worry about the HTTP verb used for the request, as input is accessed in the same way for all verbs:

    $name = $request->input('name');

You may pass a default value as the second argument to the `input` method. This value will be returned if the requested input value is not present on the request:

    $name = $request->input('name', 'Sally');

When working on forms with array inputs, you may use "dot" notation to access the arrays:

    $name = $request->input('products.0.name');

    $names = $request->input('products.*.name');

#### Determining If An Input Value Is Present

To determine if a value is present on the request, you may use the `has` method. The `has` method returns `true` if the value is present **and** is not an empty string:

    if ($request->has('name')) {
        //
    }

#### Retrieving All Input Data

You may also retrieve all of the input data as an `array` using the `all` method:

    $input = $request->all();

#### Retrieving A Portion Of The Input Data

If you need to retrieve a sub-set of the input data, you may use the `only` and `except` methods. Both of these methods will accept a single `array` or a dynamic list of arguments:

    $input = $request->only(['username', 'password']);

    $input = $request->only('username', 'password');

    $input = $request->except(['credit_card']);

    $input = $request->except('credit_card');

### Files

#### Retrieving Uploaded Files

You may access uploaded files that are included with the `Illuminate\Http\Request` instance using the `file` method. The object returned by the `file` method is an instance of the `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile` class, which extends the PHP `SplFileInfo` class and provides a variety of methods for interacting with the file:

    $file = $request->file('photo');

You may determine if a file is present on the request using the `hasFile` method:

    if ($request->hasFile('photo')) {
        //
    }

#### Validating Successful Uploads

In addition to checking if the file is present, you may verify that there were no problems uploading the file via the `isValid` method:

    if ($request->file('photo')->isValid()) {
        //
    }

#### Moving Uploaded Files

To move the uploaded file to a new location, you should use the `move` method. This method will move the file from its temporary upload location (as determined by your PHP configuration) to a more permanent destination of your choosing:

    $request->file('photo')->move($destinationPath);

    $request->file('photo')->move($destinationPath, $fileName);

#### Other File Methods

There are a variety of other methods available on `UploadedFile` instances. Check out the [API documentation for the class](http://api.symfony.com/3.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/File/UploadedFile.html) for more information regarding these methods.
