# Cache

## Introduction

Laravel provides a unified API for various caching systems. The cache configuration is located in the `.env` file. In this file you may specify which cache driver you would like used by default throughout your application. Laravel supports popular caching backends like [Memcached](http://memcached.org) and [Redis](http://redis.io) out of the box.

## Differences From Laravel

The Lumen cache drivers utilize the exact same code as the full Laravel cache drivers. Beyond configuration, there are no differences between using the cache in Lumen and using the cache in Laravel; therefore, please consult the [full Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) for usage examples.

> **Note:** Before using the `Cache` facade, be sure you have uncommented the `$app->withFacades()` method call in your `bootstrap/app.php` file.
